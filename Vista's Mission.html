        <h2>What is Vista's Mission?</h2>
        <p><h3>
            Mountain Vista excited and committed to raising money for Make-A-Wish Colorado to help create life-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses. Together, we can make more wishes come true! We're fundraising because kids and their families deserve to know the joy, relief and healing a wish can bring. A wish experience is a game-changer for children with a critical illness. Wish alumni, parents and medical professionals all agree that a wish is a necessary part of the medical treatment journey, giving kids the strength to fight against and even overcome their critical illness. Wishes increase hope, strength, joy, confidence, self-esteem, quality of life and well-being. Now, more than ever, wishes need you. Please help us support this great cause by making a donation today! With our help, Make-A-Wish Colorado can deliver strength and hope to families across the state.<br>
Thank you for your support.<br>
We are so excited for this year!</h3>
